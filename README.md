## What This Is

The Vibe Coders Starter Kit is created by [Ken Rogers](https://kenrogers.co) as part of the [Vibe Coders](https://skool.com/vibecoders/about) community on Skool.

Huge thank you to Dr. Allen Harper for providing the inspiration for this. The Vibe Coders Starter Kit was forked from his [Secure Vibe Coding OS](https://github.com/harperaa/secure-vibe-coding-OS).

**The problem with most starter templates:** They give you a basic setup, but the moment you start building, you're on your own—writing prompts from scratch, repeating mistakes, losing context between sessions.

**This template is different.** It includes:

1. **A workflow system** that makes AI-assisted development predictable
2. **A skills library** with pre-built patterns for common tasks
3. **A learning system** that captures what works and applies it automatically
4. **Production-ready infrastructure** (auth, payments, database, security)
5. **A polished design system** so your apps don't look like generic AI output

## The Core Philosophy

Most vibe coding produces throwaway prototypes. This template is designed to produce **shippable software** by baking in the practices that separate demos from products:

| Practice                | How It's Built In                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Test-driven dev**     | TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) is the default for all features     |
| **Consistent workflow** | The `/work` command guides every session                     |
| **Compound learning**   | Lessons accumulate and apply automatically                   |
| **Security by default** | Pre-built patterns for auth, CSRF, rate limiting, validation |
| **Professional design** | Design skill with patterns that avoid generic AI aesthetics  |
| **Real infrastructure** | Auth, payments, real-time database—all wired up              |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Project

Click the **"Use this template"** button at the top of this repository, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-new-repo.git
cd your-new-repo
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Services

You'll need accounts for:

- **[Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com)** — Authentication and billing
- **[Convex](https://dashboard.convex.dev)** — Real-time database

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your Clerk and Convex credentials (see Installation section below)
```

### 3. Start Development

```bash
npm run dev        # Terminal 1 - Next.js
npx convex dev     # Terminal 2 - Convex
```

### 4. Start Building

Open your AI coding tool and say:

```
/work
```

The system will guide you from there.

### Automated Setup (Amp/Claude Users)

If you're using Amp or Claude with [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/mcp_playwright), you can automate the entire installation:

```
install app
```

The AI will walk through setup automatically—creating your Clerk app, Convex project, configuring webhooks, enabling billing, and testing everything works.

## The `/work` Workflow

Instead of writing prompts from scratch each session, you use a single command that handles planning, execution, and learning automatically.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        /work                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. LEARN   - Check past lessons for what worked/failed     │
│  2. DO      - Execute with TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)         │
│  3. CAPTURE - Save learnings for next time                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### TDD Is Default

All feature work follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

```
For each feature:
  🔴 RED      → Write failing test first
  🟢 GREEN    → Minimal code to pass
  🔵 REFACTOR → Clean up (tests must still pass)
  ✓ COMMIT   → Test + implementation together
```

This prevents the AI from "cheating" by designing tests around implementations it's already planning. The test writer doesn't know how the code will be implemented—ensuring tests describe real behavior.

### Why This Matters

| Problem                           | How `/work` Fixes It                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No tests**                      | TDD is built-in—every feature gets tests automatically       |
| **Repeating mistakes**            | Automatically surfaces past learnings before you start       |
| **Lost context between sessions** | Reads project state and picks up where you left off          |
| **Forgotten lessons**             | Prompts you to capture learnings when work completes         |
| **Vague AI prompts**              | Plans are structured, executable, and atomic (2-3 tasks max) |

### How It Works

1. **Projects** break into **phases** (auth, database, UI, etc.)
2. **Phases** break into **plans** with 2-3 atomic tasks each
3. **Tasks** execute with TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor → Commit)
4. **Learnings** get captured and applied to future sessions

All state is stored in `.planning/` and lessons in `.agents/skills/lessons/`.

### All Commands

| Command        | What It Does                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/work`        | **Unified workflow with TDD (recommended)** |
| `/gsd`         | Check status, route to next action       |
| `/new-project` | Initialize project with deep questioning |
| `/roadmap`     | Break project into phases                |
| `/plan`        | Create PLAN.md (2-3 atomic tasks)        |
| `/execute`     | Run plan with TDD + atomic commits       |
| `/progress`    | Show status and next steps               |

## The Skills System

Skills are specialized instructions that activate when you need them. They encode best practices so you don't have to remember (or re-discover) the right way to do things.

### Pre-Built Skills

```
.agents/skills/
├── security/           # CSRF, rate limiting, validation, auth patterns
├── gsd/                # Project management and planning system
├── tdd/                # Test-Driven Development patterns and setup
├── frontend-design/    # UI patterns that avoid generic AI aesthetics
└── lessons/            # YOUR learnings (grows over time)
```

### How Skills Work

When you describe a task that matches a skill, the AI loads it automatically:

- "Add rate limiting to this endpoint" → loads `rate-limiting` skill
- "Build a landing page" → loads `frontend-design` skill
- "Protect this form from CSRF" → loads `csrf-protection` skill

### The Learning System

The `lessons/` directory starts empty and grows as you work:

```bash
# After completing work, capture what you learned:
/retrospective

# The system creates:
.agents/skills/lessons/implementing-stripe-webhooks/
└── SKILL.md    # What worked, what failed, exact parameters
```

Next time you work on something similar, `/work` finds and applies those lessons automatically.

| Timeline    | What Happens                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Week 1**  | Empty lessons, learn as you go                         |
| **Week 2**  | Past lessons surface automatically, work goes faster   |
| **Month 1** | 10+ lessons, most tasks have relevant experience       |
| **Month 3** | Institutional knowledge base, onboard new team members |

## Using the Security Features

### CSRF Protection

Wrap your API handlers:

```typescript
import { withCsrf } from "@/lib/withCsrf";

async function handler(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}

export const POST = withCsrf(handler);
```

Frontend usage:

```typescript
const { csrfToken } = await fetch("/api/csrf", { credentials: "include" }).then(
  (r) => r.json()
);

await fetch("/api/endpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "X-CSRF-Token": csrfToken },
  credentials: "include",
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
```

### Rate Limiting

```typescript
import { withRateLimit } from "@/lib/withRateLimit";

export const POST = withRateLimit(handler);
```

### Input Validation

```typescript
import { validateRequest } from "@/lib/validateRequest";
import { createPostSchema } from "@/lib/validation";

const validation = validateRequest(createPostSchema, body);
if (!validation.success) return validation.response;

// validation.data is type-safe and XSS-sanitized
```

### Combining Protections

```typescript
export const POST = withRateLimit(withCsrf(handler));
```

## Deployment

### Preview Deployment (Start Here)

When you're ready to test in a live environment:

```
deploy preview
```

This guided skill walks you through deploying to Vercel Preview + Convex dev:
- ✅ Live URL you can share for feedback
- ✅ Test payments with fake cards (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- ✅ Auto-updates when you push to GitHub
- ✅ No risk - can reset anytime

### Production Deployment (When Ready)

Only deploy to production when:
- All features tested in preview
- Payments verified with test cards
- You have a custom domain
- You're ready for real users and real money

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete instructions including:
- Production Clerk and Convex setup
- Custom domain configuration
- Going live with real payments
